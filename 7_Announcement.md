Dear Parasset community members,

We would like to inform you that due to the ongoing token replacement of NEST tokens, there will be an impact on Parasset transactions. In order to ensure that the token swap process of NEST tokens does not pose any risks to the Parasset contract, we plan to temporarily suspend all transactions of the Parasset contract, including NEST oracle quotations, during a specific period.

Here are the details:

Suspension Period: August 30, 2023, 17:00(UTC+8)

Resumption Time: To be notified based on the progress of the token swap

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and sincerely appreciate your understanding and support.

If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to contact us. Thank you once again for your cooperation!
